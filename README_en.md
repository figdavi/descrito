# descrito
**descrito** is browser extension that automatically generate captions for images contained in web pages.

## How it works

### Configuration
#### Popup
<p align="center">
    <img src="readme_images/descrito-popup.png" height="400px" alt="The popup interface for setting caption preferences.">
</p>

1. Captions are added either via the `alt` attribute or a `figcaption` tag.
2. If set to **"Only unlabeled images"**, the extension will check if the image already has a caption (via alt, figcaption, or aria-label). If no caption is found, it sends the image to the AI model.
3. If set to **"All images"**, it sends every image for caption generation regardless of whether it has an existing caption.

### Caption Generation

For the caption generation, the extension uses a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) Space as an API endpoint via [Gradio Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gradio/client). It sends the image as input and the AI model retrieves a caption for the image.

AI model: [BLIP](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)

Hugging Face Space: [figdavi/descrito](https://huggingface.co/spaces/figdavi/descrito)

## Example

#### Before caption generation
<img src="readme_images/pizza-before.png" alt="An example page before captions are generated.">

#### After caption generation (visible caption option)
<img src="readme_images/pizza-after.png" alt="The same page after captions are generated.">

#### Console
<img src="readme_images/pizza-console.png" alt="Console output showing the caption generation process for each image.">
